# JavaRush 
[JavaRush](http://javarush.ru/) is paid (except first 10 levels) programming online training course in Java, 80% of which consists of practice. Currently I have reached 25-th level of 40 in total. I have solved about 700 exercises which is by rough estimation about 35K+ lines of code. In order to keep [JavaRush Honor Code] (http://info.javarush.ru/page/honorcode/) relatively unimpaired I am posting only few examples of my solutions for demonstration purposes.
