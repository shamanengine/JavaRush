# JavaRush 
- JavaRush is paid (except first 10 levels) programming online training course in Java, 80% of which consists of practice. 
- Currently I have reached 30-th level of 40 in total. 
I have solved about 700 exercises which is by rough estimation about 35k+ lines of code. In order to keep JavaRush Honor Code relatively unimpaired I am posting only few examples of my solutions for demonstration purposes.
